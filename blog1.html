                  <br>
             <b>1.	Yellow stem borer</b> <br>
                  Order:- Lepidoptera <br>
                  Family:- Pyralidae <br>
                  <br>

                  <br>
                 It is Absolute/Monophagus pest of rice. 
                  
                 <u>Interesting Fact</u> <br>
                  Female have black spots in the wings.<br>
                  The size of the female is greater than male. <br>
                  Eggs are covered by brown thin hairy structure. <br>
                  Pupa is present inside the plant. <br>
                  <u>Symptoms</u> <br>
                  The damage is caused by caterpillars.
                  Caterpillar first eat internal succulent part of the plant 
                  then stays in the pith.
                   ‘Dead Heart’ formation takes place before flowering and after flowering ‘White Ear Head’ develops. 
                   Symptom of the caterpillar is always seen above the water level.
                  <br> <br>
                 <u>How can we manage “Yellow stem borer”?</u> <br> 
                  •	Eggs of the stem borer are present near the leaf tip, hence clipping and burning of tips of seedling before transplanting. <br>
                  •	Since Basmati varieties suffer heavy damage. Think before planting Basmati varieties. <br>
                  Prasitoids (wasps)<i>Trichogramma</i> sp are used to control the eggs of stemborers.
                  
                  <br>
             <b>2) Rice hispa (<i>Diclodispa armigera</i>)</b> <br>
                  •	Order:- Coleoptera <br>
                  •	Family:- Chrysomelidae <br>
                  <img src="blog1 images/rice hispa.jpg" width="300px" alt="Yellow Stem Borer">
                  <br>
                 <u>Interesting fact</u> <br>
                  Also called spiny beetle. <br>
                  •	It is a small bluish black bettle having numerous short spines on the body. <br>
                  Creamy white color grubs remain concealed inside the leaf tissue because they are legless. <br>
                  <br>
                  <u>Symptoms</u> <br>
                  •	The symptoms are similar as leaf minors. <br>
                  It mines between the epidermal layes of leaf and pupates in 
                  leaf mines. <br>
                  •	Transparent blotches on the leaf surface are seen which are caused by larvae. <br>
                  •	Parallel whitish streaks are seen in leaves which are caused by adult. <br>
                  Attacked plant look membranous, with blisters and blotches.
                  <br>
                  <u>Management</u> <br>
                  •	Irrigate the field and collect the floated beetles by nets and killed. <br>
                  •	Clip off the leaf tips before transplanting  seedlings. <br>
                  •	Chlorpyriphos @ 625 ml spray with 250 liters of water. <br>
                  Conserve natural predator like Assassain Bug.

              <b>3.	Rice gundhi bug/ Rice earhead bug (Leptocorisa acuta)</b> <br>
                  Order:- Hemiptera <br>
                  Family:- Coreidae <br>
                  <br>
                  <img src="blog1 images/rice gundhi bug.jpg" width="300px" alt="Yellow Stem Borer">
                  <br>
                  It is the Periodic pest of rice.
                  Also known as Rice Stink Bug.

                <u>Interesting fact</u> <br>
                   <br>
                   Triangular shape head is present. <br>

                  Females are more active than males. <br>
                  <br>
                 <u>Symptoms</u> <br>
                  In milky stage, nymphs and adult suck sap from the grains. This cause incompletely filled panicles or panicles with empty grains.
                  Bugs made the hole. Black and brown color appears around the holes and sooty mould may develop. <br>
                  <br>
                <u>Management</u> <br>
                  Light traps are used to capture adult bugs. <br>
                  Remove alternate host, <i>Echinocloa</i> from field. <br>
                  Spray Malathion 50 EC @ 675 ml/ha <br>
                  Use predators like tiger beetle.

             <b>4.	Plant hopper</b> <br>
                  Order:- Hemiptera <br>
                  Family:- Delphacidae <br>
                  Two types of plant hopper are seen in rice field. <br>
                  <br>
               <ins>   a)	White Backed Plant Hopper (Sogatella furcifera) </ins> <br>
               <img src="blog1 images/white backed plant hopper.jpg" width="300px" alt="Yellow Stem Borer">
               <br>
                  Attacks in early crop season. <br>
                  •	Serious pest of high yielding varieties of paddy <br>
                  •	Cause rust red symptom <br>
                  <br>
                <ins>  b)	Brown Plant Hopper (Nilaparvata lugens) </ins> <br>
                <img src="blog1 images/brown plant hopper.jpg" width="300px" alt="Yellow Stem Borer">
                <br>
                  Attacks in later crop season. <br>
                  It transmit the ‘grassy stunt virus’ disease of rice. <br>
                  Both white and brown plant hopper emit a toxin into the plant which produces a particular symptom known as ‘Hopper burn’. <br>
                  It has a brown body and chestnut brown eyes. <br>
                  Macropterous (long winged) and brachypterous (short winged) are the two forms
                  of adult. <br>
                  <br>
               <u>Management</u> <br>
                  Use multi gene resistant varieties: IR-36, IR-60 <br>
                  Alternate drying and wetting of field <br>
                  20 * 15 cm spacing is suited. Avoid closer spacing. <br>
                  Avoid use of insecticides causing resurgence such as synthetic pyrethroids
                  methyl parathion etc. <br>
                  Before use of insectides, drain the water and direct spray towards 
                  the base of the plants. <br>
                  Spray of 100 ml Imidaeloprid (200 SL) with 250 liters of water. <br>
