            Absolute/Monophagus pest of rice.<br>
            Pupa is present inside the plant. <br>

           <u>How can we manage “Yellow stem borer”?</u> <br> 
            •	Eggs of the stem borer are present near the leaf tip, hence clipping and burning of tips of seedling before transplanting. <br>
            •	Since Basmati varieties suffer heavy damage. Think before planting Basmati varieties. <br>
            <br>
            <b>2) Rice hispa (Diclodispa armigera)</b> <br>
            •	Order:- Coleoptera <br>

            •	The symptoms are similar as leaf minors. <br>
            •	Transparent blotches on the leaf surface are seen which are caused by larvae. <br>
            •	Parallel whitish streaks are seen in leaves which are caused by adult. <br>
            <br>
            <u>Management</u> <br>
            •	Irrigate the field and collect the floated beetles by nets and killed. <br>
            •	Clip off the leaf tips before transplanting  seedlings. <br>
            •	Chlorpyriphos @ 625 ml spray with 250 liters of water. <br>
    <br>
            <b>3.	Rice gundhi bug/ Rice earhead bug (Leptocorisa acuta)</b> <br>
            Order:- Hemiptera <br>
            Family:- Coreidae <br>
            <br>
          <u>Interesting fact</u> <br>

            Pest emits pungent smell, therefore named ‘gundhi bug’. <br>
            <br>
           <u>Symptoms</u> <br>
            In milky stage, nymphs and adult suck sap from the grains. This cause incompletely filled panicles or panicles with empty grains.

            <br>
          <u>Management</u> <br>
            Light traps are used to capture adult bugs. <br>

            Order:- Hemiptera <br>
            Family:- Delphacidae <br>
            Two types of plant hopper are seen in rice field. <br>
            <br>
         <ins>   a)	White Backed Plant Hopper (Sogatella furcifera) </ins> <br>
            Attacks in early crop season. <br>
            •	Serious pest of high yielding varieties of paddy <br>
            •	Cause rust red symptom <br>
            <br>
          <ins>  b)	Brown Plant Hopper (Nilaparvata lugens) </ins> <br>

            It transmit the ‘grassy stunt virus’ disease of rice. <br>
            Both white and brown plant hopper emit a toxin into the plant which produces a particular symptom known as ‘Hopper burn’. <br>
            <br>
         <u>Management</u> <br>
            Use multi gene resistant varieties: IR-36, IR-60 <br>
            Alternate drying and wetting of field <br>
            20 * 15 cm spacing is suited. Avoid closer spacing. <br>
