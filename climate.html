              <h1>What is climate change?</h1>
              <p>
                Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature
                and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such 
                as through variations in the solar cycle. <br>
        
            
                <h3>Weather</h3>
                <p> 
                    Weather describes the conditions outside right now in a 
                    specific place. For example, if you see that it’s raining
                     outside right now, that’s a way to describe today’s 
                     weather. Rain, snow, wind, hurricanes, tornadoes — 
                     these are all weather events.
                </p>
        
                <h3>Climate</h3>
                <p>
                    Climate, on the other hand, is more than just one or two
                     rainy days. Climate describes the weather conditions 
                     that are expected in a region at a particular time of
                      year.
                </p>
        
                <h4>Remember</h4>
                <p>
                <em>Is it usually rainy or usually dry? Is it typically hot or 
                typically cold? A region’s climate is determined by 
                observing its weather over a period of many years—generally
                 30 years or more. </em>
                </p>

              <h1>What causes climate change?</h1>
              <p>
                Climate change is caused by the release of 'greenhouse' gases
                into the atmosphere. These gases accumulate in the atmosphere,
                which result global warming. The changes in global climate related parametes such as 
                temperature, precipitaion, soil moisture and sea level. 
                <em>However, the reliability of the predictions on climate change
                is uncertain. </em>
              </p>

              <p>
            Volcanic eruptions, floods, forest fires are also responsible for
            climate change. Human activities such as deforestation, burning fossil 
               fuels, farming livestock etc., generate an enormous amount of 
               greenhouse gases. This results in greenhouse effect and global 
               warming which are the major causes for climate change.

                <h1>What are the effects of climate change?</h1>
        
                <p>
                    The impacts of climate change on different sectors of
                     society are interrelated.
                    Drought can harm food production and human health.
                     Flooding can lead to disease spread and damages to 
                     ecosystems and infrastructure.

                <p>
              If the current situation of climate change continues in a similar
            manner then it will impact all forms of life on the earth. The earth
            temperature will rise, the monsoon patterns will change, sea levels 
            will rise, and storms, volcanic eruptions and natural disasters will
             occur frequently. The biological and ecological balance of the earth    will get disturbed. The environment will get polluted and humans 
             will not be able to get fresh air to breath and fresh water to drink. 
             Life on earth will come to an end.

                    Global temperatures rose about 1.8°F (1°C) from 1901 to 2020. <br>
                    <br>
                 Snow is melting earlier compared to long-term averages. <br>
                 <br>
             The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by
                     25% since 1958, and by about 40% since the Industrial Revolution. <br>
                     <br>
                The area covered by sea ice in the Arctic at the end of summer has 
                     shrunk by about 40% since 1979. <br>
                     <br>
                     Glaciers are shrinking: average thickness of 30 well-studied glaciers has decreased more than 60 feet since 1980. <br>
                     <br>
                     Sea level rise has accelerated from 1.7 mm/year throughout most of the twentieth century to 3.2 mm/year since 1993.

                <p> We need to minimise the use of fossil fuels, which is the major 
                    cause for global warming. We must adopt alternative sources of energy,
                     such as hydropower, solar and wind energy to make a progressive
                     transition to clean energy.
                    
                    Mahatma Gandhi said that, “Earth provides enough to satisfy every
                     man’s need, but not any man’s greed”. With this view, we must 
                    remodel our outlook and achieve the goal of sustainable development.</p>
